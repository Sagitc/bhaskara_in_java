This is a program that calculate two roots of a quadratic equation through the famous bhaskára, in other words:

(-b ± √delta)/2*a        //        delta = sqrt(b²-4*a*c)

reference: ax²+bx+c


Things that you have to know:

    1° - Bhaskára is a mathematical formula that gives you, in most case, two numbers that are roots of the equation, in other words, two numbers that makes the equation be 0.
    2° - Using bhaskára gives you three endings: delta < 0, delta = 0 and delta > 0

When delta > 0:
    That means that the equation has two roots;

Whenn delta = 0:
    That means that the equation has two roots, however theses two are the same. r1 = r2.

When delta < 0:
    Well, when this happens mean that the equation doesn't have real roots. We will not go futher when this case happens.
